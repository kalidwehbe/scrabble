This project is a text-based version of the game Scrabble, utilizing an MVC design pattern (Model-View-Composition). The program prompts 2-4 players to write their name. Once all is good to go it reads a dictionary with valid words, and uses 4 main components: GameModel, ConsoleView, GameController, and GameObserver for the observer pattern. GameModel holds all the data and logic behind the program. ConsoleView takes care of the view of the board, which is a grid, and the GameController manages the user's input and how it interacts with the user and ConsoleView. The GameObserver is an observer pattern interface that updates the board. The things that are missing are, user cannot automatically start in the middle of the grid like how in an actual game the user starts, tile swapping where a player can skip a turn to exchange any number of tiles or even another end condition for winning except for EXIT.
MILESTONE 2:
This Java Scrabble game implements a graphical user interface using Swing and follows the MVC pattern. Players can place words on a 15x15 board, swap tiles, pass their turn, and track scores, with all moves validated against a dictionary, ensuring that only valid words are accepted. The GUI displays the board, player racks, scores, instructions, current turn, and error messages, providing clear feedback for user actions. The controller handles input, interprets commands, and communicates with the model, while the model manages the game state, tile bag, and scoring logic. The game uses the observer pattern so the view updates automatically whenever the model changes, keeping the interface synchronized with the game state. Additionally, the first move always starts in the middle of the board, simplifying initial placement, and the interface provides intuitive guidance to players throughout the game.
