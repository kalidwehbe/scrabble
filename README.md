This project is a text-based version of the game Scrabble, utilizing an MVC design pattern (Model-View-Composition). The program prompts 2-4 players to write their name. Once all is good to go it reads a dictionary with valid words, and uses 4 main components: GameModel, ConsoleView, GameController, and GameObserver for the observer pattern. GameModel holds all the data and logic behind the program. ConsoleView takes care of the view of the board, which is a grid, and the GameController manages the user's input and how it interacts with the user and ConsoleView. The GameObserver is an observer pattern interface that updates the board. The things that are missing are, user cannot automatically start in the middle of the grid like how in an actual game the user starts, tile swapping where a player can skip a turn to exchange any number of tiles or even another end condition for winning except for EXIT.
